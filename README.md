**Cheating**

As a student at UiT, you are obliged to familiarize yourself with the
current rules that apply to the use of aids during exams, as well as
rules for source use and citation. In the case of violation of these
rules, you may be suspected of cheating, or attempt at
cheating. Cheating on an exam is considered a violation of academic
integrity. Academic integrity(honesty) is about being clear in
relation to which thoughts/reflection and work are one's own, and
which are taken from other's work. Cheating is punishable by
cancellation of exams and/or exclusion from university.

## Readings

1. Andrew Tanenbaum, Herbert Bos, Modern Operating Systems Fifth Edition, Global Edition.
2. Lecture notes
3. Mandatory assignments

## Mandatory assignments

| Project | Subject                                      | Lecturer |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| P1      |                                              | MM       |
| P2      |                                              | MM       |
| P3      |                                              | MM       |
| P4      |                                              | MM       |

We are restructuring the course. P1 is no longer a mandatory project,
and some of tasks from the old P1 project are moved to P2.

## Deadlines ⏰
As a general rule
- hand out projects **not before** lectures on Tuesday.
- hand in projects **14:30** Friday before next project.
- grades published **not before 12:00** Friday after hand in

## Design reviews 🔍
In this course, we mandate that you participate in 'design reviews`.

So what is a design review?

Design review is a short session between a TA and a group, typically 10 minutes, inviting you to explain how you plan to solve the ongoing mandatory project. There is no time for an in-depth explanation of code, algorithms, etc., you must summarize and give a precise presentation of your solution's abstract **design**.

Design reviews are broken into a few stages.
1. You hold a presentation about what the problem(s) is/are and how you think you can solve it
2. The TA will ask you questions typically about
  - Topics you did not cover
  - Topics you were unclear about
3. You get feedback and grade.
  - If you do not pass, don't worry. You will get a second chance, reschedule with your TA.

The whole idea of design reviews is to make sure you pass the assignments!

When will the design reviews take place?

During colloquium hours the week after hand-out.

## Hand-in 📮
- Deliver assignments by deadline on canvas
  - Format should be .zip
  - Remember to include your report!
- Remember to remove any prebuilt binaries (make clean)
- Include everything i.e. hidden folders such as .git
