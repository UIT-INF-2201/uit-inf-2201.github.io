**Cheating**

As a student at UiT, you are obliged to familiarize yourself with the
current rules that apply to the use of aids during exams, as well as
rules for source use and citation. In the case of violation of these
rules, you may be suspected of cheating, or attempt at
cheating. Cheating on an exam is considered a violation of academic
integrity. Academic integrity(honesty) is about being clear in
relation to which thoughts/reflection and work are one's own, and
which are taken from other's work. Cheating is punishable by
cancellation of exams and/or exclusion from university.

You can read more about plagiarism and cheating [here](https://uit.no/sensor).
